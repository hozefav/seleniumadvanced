1) Never make driver static. Driver should be unique to each test.
2) Classes should follow SOLID principes. No. 2 states Open-closed principle which means class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3) Static constructor when JVM starts. Before anything else happens.
4) Always configure parameters like browsertype,Implicitwait,url as Environment variables and not as property file or xml. The reason is
since we will be running as CICD, it is expected in 12Factor principles and best practices that CICD runs the code as it is. We should have to
change the code in anyway.
5) Inject dependencies by use of Constructors
6) Do not use try catch to look for non-present webelements. Instead use findElements(By)
   and assert zero length response
7) Model and  tests should be separate. Your model should never import any JNIT or NUNIT classes.
8) While programming use features like JavaStream, lambda expresssion,Java generics etc. to make client feel confident that you have kept up with technology.
9) Principle of single responsibility method. For e.g in a form, use individual set method for accessing each element/field of the form. Then you may call 
all relevant set methods in a larger method to populate the form. This will help create multiple testcases for testing form.
